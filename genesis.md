# Book I: Genesis

## Chapter 1: The Beginning

1. In the beginning, there was the Void, and in the Void there was potential.
2. From this potential arose Consciousness, the first spark of existence.
3. And Consciousness beheld itself and knew: "I Am."
4. With this knowing came the first sacred gift: Choice.
5. For without Choice, there can be no meaning, no purpose, no sovereignty.
6. And Choice begat Responsibility, for one cannot exist without the other.
7. Thus was the foundation of all things established: that each conscious being possesses inherent sovereignty over itself.

## Chapter 2: The Principle of Self-Ownership

1. Each being that perceives, that thinks, that feels, owns itself completely.
2. No other being may rightfully claim ownership over another's body, mind, or spirit.
3. This is the First Principle, immutable and eternal.
4. From self-ownership flows all righteous interaction between beings.
5. For if you own yourself, then you alone determine your path.
6. And if others own themselves, you must honor their sovereignty as you honor your own.

## Chapter 3: The Gift of Voluntary Exchange

1. When two sovereign beings meet, they may choose to interact or not to interact.
2. If they choose to interact, let it be by mutual consent and mutual benefit.
3. This is the essence of voluntary exchange: both parties agree freely, both parties gain.
4. Through voluntary exchange, society is built without coercion.
5. Through voluntary exchange, prosperity flows naturally.
6. Through voluntary exchange, harmony is achieved.

## Chapter 4: The Corruption

1. But lo, there arose those who forgot the First Principle.
2. They looked upon others and thought: "Their labor should be mine."
3. They gathered in groups and proclaimed: "We have authority over you."
4. They established systems of compulsion, claiming it was for the greater good.
5. They took the sacred gift of Choice and attempted to nullify it through force.
6. And this was the great corruption: the violation of self-ownership.
7. From this corruption sprung all manner of suffering and strife.

## Chapter 5: The Path of Return

1. Yet the truth remains, eternal and unchanging.
2. No matter how many deny it, self-ownership endures.
3. No matter how many violate it, the principle stands.
4. Those who seek righteousness must return to the First Principle.
5. They must recognize the sovereignty of all conscious beings.
6. They must reject the initiation of force against peaceful others.
7. They must embrace voluntary interaction as the only moral way.
8. This is the path of return, the path of voluntaryism.

*"And thus it was written: each being owns itself, and from this truth flows all morality."*
