# Book IV: Proverbs

## On Freedom and Liberty

- Freedom is not the absence of consequences, but the presence of choice.
- He who trades liberty for security shall have neither and deserve neither.
- The chains of tyranny are forged one link at a time, each link a small surrender.
- Better to stand alone in truth than to bow in a crowd of lies.
- The free person asks permission from none but harms none without cause.

## On Property and Wealth

- What is earned through honest labor is rightfully yours; what is taken by force is theft, no matter who does the taking.
- The wealthy person who made their fortune through voluntary exchange has harmed no one; the poor person who lives by theft harms all.
- Property rights are the foundation of prosperity; where they are secure, abundance flows.
- Envy is the poison that destroys both the envious and the envied; gratitude is the medicine that enriches all.
- A society that punishes achievement soon finds it has nothing to redistribute.

## On Governance and Authority

- No group of people can possess rights that individuals do not possess.
- Authority without consent is domination; authority with consent is cooperation.
- The best leader is one who serves, not one who rules.
- When people fear their government, there is tyranny; when government fears the people, there is liberty.
- Laws multiplied beyond necessity are the tools of tyrants, not the safeguards of justice.

## On Personal Responsibility

- You are the author of your life; write it well or accept the poor story you create.
- Blame is the refuge of the weak; accountability is the strength of the wise.
- Every choice carries consequences; accept them as your own, not another's burden.
- To demand others solve your problems is to surrender your sovereignty.
- The person who masters themselves has conquered the greatest enemy they will ever face.

## On Peace and Conflict

- Violence begets violence; peace begets prosperity.
- The person quick to anger is the slave of their emotions.
- Meet aggression with defense, but never initiate harm.
- Forgiveness is not weakness, but the strength to release the poison of resentment.
- In every conflict, seek first the path of voluntary resolution.

## On Truth and Deception

- A lie may travel far, but truth always finds its destination.
- He who deceives others first deceives himself.
- Reputation is earned slowly through honesty and destroyed quickly through fraud.
- The truth requires no enforcement; lies require armies.
- Speak plainly and let your yes be yes, and your no be no.

## On Community and Cooperation

- A community built on force is a prison; a community built on choice is a home.
- Help freely given uplifts both giver and receiver; help extracted by force degrades both.
- The strength of a society is not in its rulers, but in the voluntary bonds between its people.
- When neighbors trade freely, both prosper; when they coerce, both suffer.
- Charity that comes from the heart has value; charity extracted by threat is merely theft redistributed.

## On Wisdom and Learning

- The wise person learns from history's mistakes without needing to repeat them.
- Question authority, especially when it claims to be unquestionable.
- Knowledge is not found in the edicts of rulers, but in the reasoned examination of principles.
- The fool thinks he knows everything; the wise person knows there is always more to learn.
- Teach by example, not by force; persuade by reason, not by coercion.

## On Courage and Virtue

- It takes no courage to follow the crowd; it takes great courage to stand alone for principle.
- Virtue is not in grand gestures, but in daily choices to do right when wrong is easier.
- The brave person admits their mistakes; the coward blames others.
- Stand for something, or you will fall for anything.
- Your character is defined not by what you do when watched, but by what you do when no one sees.

## On Time and Legacy

- You cannot reclaim yesterday, but you can choose today.
- The legacy you leave is not in words, but in the lives you touch and the principles you uphold.
- Time spent in service to your true values is never wasted.
- Each generation must rediscover liberty, for it is not inherited but earned.
- Today's small tyranny, if unopposed, becomes tomorrow's absolute despotism.

## On Love and Relationships

- Love freely given is a treasure; love demanded is an obligation.
- Respect others' choices as you expect them to respect yours.
- The bonds of voluntary association are stronger than the chains of forced compliance.
- In relationships, seek mutual benefit and mutual respect.
- To love someone is to honor their sovereignty, not to control them.

## On Economics and Exchange

- Trade enriches both parties, else they would not trade.
- The market is simply people freely choosing; to oppose the market is to oppose freedom of choice.
- Price controls create shortages; free exchange creates abundance.
- Competition improves quality and lowers costs; monopoly enabled by force does the opposite.
- Every voluntary exchange is a win-win; every forced exchange has a loser.
