# Book II: Principles

## Chapter 1: The Non-Aggression Principle

1. Thou shalt not initiate force or fraud against another peaceful being.
2. For to do so is to violate their self-ownership, their sacred sovereignty.
3. Defense against aggression is righteous, but aggression itself is not.
4. This is the cornerstone of all moral law: harm none who harm not you.
5. All just societies are built upon this foundation.
6. All unjust societies violate this principle.

## Chapter 2: The Principle of Consent

1. Before you may take what another possesses, you must have their consent.
2. Before you may use another's labor, you must have their consent.
3. Before you may enter another's property, you must have their consent.
4. Consent freely given is the mark of voluntary interaction.
5. Consent obtained through coercion is no consent at all.
6. To ignore consent is to commit aggression.

## Chapter 3: The Principle of Peaceful Cooperation

1. When beings interact voluntarily, both benefit.
2. When beings are forced to interact, at least one suffers.
3. Therefore, seek always the path of cooperation, not coercion.
4. Build communities on mutual benefit, not on domination.
5. Resolve disputes through reason and arbitration, not violence.
6. For peaceful cooperation is the wellspring of all prosperity.

## Chapter 4: The Principle of Personal Responsibility

1. You are responsible for your own choices and their consequences.
2. You are not responsible for the choices of others, nor they for yours.
3. To act is to accept the outcomes of your actions.
4. To blame others for your choices is to deny your own sovereignty.
5. To force others to bear the costs of your choices is theft.
6. Take ownership of your path, for it is yours alone to walk.

## Chapter 5: The Principle of Property Rights

1. What you justly acquire through your labor, or through voluntary exchange, is yours.
2. Your property is an extension of your self-ownership.
3. To take another's property without consent is theft.
4. To damage another's property is aggression.
5. Property rights enable prosperity, for who would labor if the fruits could be seized?
6. Respect the property of others as you would have them respect yours.

## Chapter 6: The Principle of Freedom of Association

1. You may choose with whom you associate, or not associate.
2. You may choose to form communities with like-minded individuals.
3. You may choose to refuse association with those whose values differ from yours.
4. No one may force you to associate, nor may you force others.
5. Freedom of association is essential to liberty.
6. Forced association breeds resentment; voluntary association breeds harmony.

## Chapter 7: The Principle of Honest Exchange

1. In all dealings, speak truth and honor your agreements.
2. Fraud is a form of theft, for it obtains by deception what consent would not grant.
3. Your word is sacred; breaking it damages not just others but your own integrity.
4. In a voluntary society, reputation is currency.
5. Those who deal honestly prosper in the long term.
6. Those who deceive may gain in the moment but lose trust forever.
