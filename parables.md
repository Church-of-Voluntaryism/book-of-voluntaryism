# Book III: Parables

## The Parable of the Forced Garden

1. There was once a community of gardeners, each tending their own plot of land.
2. Each gardener grew what they wished: some flowers, some vegetables, some herbs.
3. They would trade amongst themselves voluntarily, each benefiting from the variety.
4. One day, a group arose and declared: "We shall organize all gardens for the common good."
5. They forced each gardener to grow what the group decreed, not what the gardener chose.
6. They took a portion of each harvest, claiming it was necessary for administration.
7. The gardeners grew resentful, for their sovereignty was violated.
8. Production fell, for why labor intensely when the fruits are seized?
9. The gardens withered, and the community grew poor.
10. But the organizers blamed the gardeners, never acknowledging that coercion was the root of decay.

*Lesson: What is obtained through force cannot prosper, for it lacks the vital element of voluntary commitment.*

## The Parable of the Two Merchants

1. In a bustling marketplace, there were two merchants selling similar wares.
2. The first merchant offered fair prices and honest quality, treating customers with respect.
3. The second merchant charged high prices and used deceptive practices.
4. At first, both had customers, for the second merchant was skilled at manipulation.
5. But over time, word spread of each merchant's character.
6. Customers flocked to the honest merchant, while the dishonest one's stall grew empty.
7. The dishonest merchant complained, "This is unfair! Someone should force people to buy from me!"
8. But the people responded, "You have the freedom to sell, and we have the freedom to choose."
9. The dishonest merchant could either reform his ways or fail.
10. He chose to reform, and the marketplace thrived with two honest merchants.

*Lesson: In a free society, honesty and quality naturally prevail, for people vote with their choices.*

## The Parable of the Bridge Builder

1. A village was separated from fertile land by a wide river.
2. A skilled builder saw an opportunity and proposed to build a bridge.
3. She asked the villagers: "Who wishes to use this bridge? Contribute what you will, and I shall build it."
4. Some contributed much, some little, some nothing at all.
5. With the contributions, the builder constructed a fine bridge.
6. Those who contributed were given tokens to cross freely.
7. Those who did not contribute could pay a small fee each time.
8. Everyone benefited: contributors had reliable access, non-contributors could still cross for a price.
9. The builder profited from her skill and effort, the villagers from the access.
10. All was done without force, and all parties were satisfied.

*Lesson: Voluntary cooperation can solve common problems without coercion, benefiting all involved.*

## The Parable of the Protected Village

1. A village hired guards to protect them from bandits.
2. The guards did their job well, and the village prospered in safety.
3. Over time, the guards began to demand more payment.
4. They said, "Without us, you would be destroyed. You owe us everything."
5. The villagers agreed to pay more, for they feared the bandits.
6. But the demands never ceased; each year the guards required more.
7. One day, the guards demanded half of all the village produced.
8. A wise elder asked, "What is the difference between our guards and the bandits they protect us from?"
9. The guards grew angry at this question and threatened the elder.
10. Then the villagers understood: those who claim to protect through force become the very thing they claim to guard against.

*Lesson: Power without accountability and consent inevitably becomes tyranny.*

## The Parable of the Fisherman's Nets

1. A fisherman owned several nets, which he used to catch fish.
2. His neighbor, seeing the fisherman's success, desired nets of his own.
3. The neighbor could have made nets, or offered to trade for them, or asked to borrow them.
4. Instead, the neighbor gathered a group who declared: "Fisherman, you have more nets than you need. We shall redistribute them."
5. They took the fisherman's nets and gave them to those who had none.
6. The fisherman, disheartened by this theft, stopped making new nets.
7. Within a season, all the nets were worn and broken, and none had the skill to repair them.
8. The village that once had abundant fish now went hungry.
9. The group that redistributed blamed the fisherman for not continuing to make nets.
10. But the fisherman replied, "Why would I create what you will only seize?"

*Lesson: When property rights are violated, productive effort ceases, and all suffer.*

## The Parable of the Voluntary Defense

1. A group of families lived in proximity and faced threats from raiders.
2. They met and discussed: "How shall we defend ourselves?"
3. Some said, "Let us force everyone to contribute to a common defense force."
4. Others said, "Let each contribute voluntarily what they wish."
5. They chose the voluntary path, and most contributed according to their means.
6. One family contributed nothing, saying, "We prefer to rely on our own devices."
7. The others respected this choice, though they disagreed.
8. When raiders came, the defense force protected all who had contributed.
9. The non-contributing family defended themselves as best they could.
10. In time, seeing the value of cooperation, they chose to join, and the defense grew stronger.

*Lesson: Voluntary association is stronger than forced compliance, for it is built on genuine commitment.*
