# Book IV: Proverbs

## On Freedom and Liberty

- Freedom is not the absence of consequences, but the presence of choice.
- He who trades liberty for security shall have neither and deserve neither.
- The chains of tyranny are forged one link at a time, each link a small surrender.
- Better to stand alone in truth than to bow in a crowd of lies.
- The free person asks permission from none but harms none without cause.

## On Property and Wealth

- What is earned through honest labor is rightfully yours; what is taken by force is theft, no matter who does the taking.
- The wealthy person who made their fortune through voluntary exchange has harmed no one; the poor person who lives by theft harms all.
- Property rights are the foundation of prosperity; where they are secure, abundance flows.
- Envy is the poison that destroys both the envious and the envied; gratitude is the medicine that enriches all.
- A society that punishes achievement soon finds it has nothing to redistribute.

## On Governance and Authority

- No group of people can possess rights that individuals do not possess.
- Authority without consent is domination; authority with consent is cooperation.
- The best leader is one who serves, not one who rules.
- When people fear their government, there is tyranny; when government fears the people, there is liberty.
- Laws multiplied beyond necessity are the tools of tyrants, not the safeguards of justice.

## On Personal Responsibility

- You are the author of your life; write it well or accept the poor story you create.
- Blame is the refuge of the weak; accountability is the strength of the wise.
- Every choice carries consequences; accept them as your own, not another's burden.
- To demand others solve your problems is to surrender your sovereignty.
- The person who masters themselves has conquered the greatest enemy they will ever face.

## On Peace and Conflict
