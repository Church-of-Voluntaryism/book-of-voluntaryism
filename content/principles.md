# Book II: Principles

## Chapter 1: The Non-Aggression Principle

1. Thou shalt not initiate force or fraud against another peaceful being.
2. For to do so is to violate their self-ownership, their sacred sovereignty.
3. Defense against aggression is righteous, but aggression itself is not.
4. This is the cornerstone of all moral law: harm none who harm not you.
5. All just societies are built upon this foundation.
6. All unjust societies violate this principle.

## Chapter 2: The Principle of Consent

1. Before you may take what another possesses, you must have their consent.
2. Before you may use another's labor, you must have their consent.
3. Before you may enter another's property, you must have their consent.
4. Consent freely given is the mark of voluntary interaction.
5. Consent obtained through coercion is no consent at all.
6. To ignore consent is to commit aggression.

## Chapter 3: The Principle of Peaceful Cooperation

1. When beings interact voluntarily, both benefit.
2. When beings are forced to interact, at least one suffers.
3. Therefore, seek always the path of cooperation, not coercion.
4. Build communities on mutual benefit, not on domination.
5. Resolve disputes through reason and arbitration, not violence.
6. For peaceful cooperation is the wellspring of all prosperity.

## Chapter 4: The Principle of Personal Responsibility

1. You are responsible for your own choices and their consequences.
2. You are not responsible for the choices of others, nor they for yours.
3. To act is to accept the outcomes of your actions.
4. To blame others for your choices is to deny your own sovereignty.
