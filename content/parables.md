# Book III: Parables

## The Parable of the Forced Garden

1. There was once a community of gardeners, each tending their own plot of land.
2. Each gardener grew what they wished: some flowers, some vegetables, some herbs.
3. They would trade amongst themselves voluntarily, each benefiting from the variety.
4. One day, a group arose and declared: "We shall organize all gardens for the common good."
5. They forced each gardener to grow what the group decreed, not what the gardener chose.
6. They took a portion of each harvest, claiming it was necessary for administration.
7. The gardeners grew resentful, for their sovereignty was violated.
8. Production fell, for why labor intensely when the fruits are seized?
9. The gardens withered, and the community grew poor.
10. But the organizers blamed the gardeners, never acknowledging that coercion was the root of decay.

*Lesson: What is obtained through force cannot prosper, for it lacks the vital element of voluntary commitment.*

## The Parable of the Two Merchants

1. In a bustling marketplace, there were two merchants selling similar wares.
2. The first merchant offered fair prices and honest quality, treating customers with respect.
3. The second merchant charged high prices and used deceptive practices.
4. At first, both had customers, for the second merchant was skilled at manipulation.
5. But over time, word spread of each merchant's character.
6. Customers flocked to the honest merchant, while the dishonest one's stall grew empty.
7. The dishonest merchant complained, "This is unfair! Someone should force people to buy from me!"
8. But the people responded, "You have the freedom to sell, and we have the freedom to choose."
9. The dishonest merchant could either reform his ways or fail.
10. He chose to reform, and the marketplace thrived with two honest merchants.

*Lesson: In a free society, honesty and quality naturally prevail, for people vote with their choices.*

## The Parable of the Bridge Builder

1. A village was separated from fertile land by a wide river.
